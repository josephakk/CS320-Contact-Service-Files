To ensure that your code is functional and secure, it is important to adopt rigorous testing practices. Unit testing should be the first and foremost of these practices.
This will help ensure that the individual componenets of the program or system operate as intended. Integration testing ensures smooth collaboration between the different units, and complete
system testing will check that the entire system functions as intended. Conducting regular security assessments, code reviews, and vulnerability scanning can also enhance your software.

To ensure that the software you are designing and creating fully meets the needs of your clients, you need to be able to communicate thoroughly and understand the needs of the end-users.
This can be accomplished though frequent communication between the development team and the stakeholders or end-users.

Designing and developing software is an iterative process that require developers to be able to adapt. The first stage is to gather requirements for the software that you will be designing. 
The requirements will give the developers a clear objective to meet. As development continues, feedback loops should be established with stakeholders and end-users to ensure that their
requirements are being met. These feedback loops will help developers iterate and change the software where necessary. The iterative nature of software development ensures that the end
product matches the user's expectations and needs.
